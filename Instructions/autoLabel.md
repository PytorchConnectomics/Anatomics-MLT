# Auto-Labelling

Brief Description of Auto-Labelling

# How to use Auto-Labelling Page

To use the Auto-Labelling Feature, you must first train a model. Once you have a model trained, you can use the Auto-Label page, which looks like this:

The most important inputs that you must fill out are the following:

- Image Stack: Must put your stack of images that you want to label (can be created from a folder of seperate images using the ImageTools section)
- Output File: Pick an output file to put the predictions in. You need to remember this file, as you select it to make 3D reconstructions and get stats
- Model To Use: Select the name of the model you want to make the predictions

> These are the only fields that must be filled out. The rest have default values that should work just fine, and will be described in better detail below in case you want to tweak them.

Next, click the Label button, the text box below will print out information updating you on progress, and let you know when the auto-labelling is complete.
