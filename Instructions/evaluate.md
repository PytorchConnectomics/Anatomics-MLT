# Evaluate Model

brief Description

# Evaluate Button

> To be implemented, will compare a model output .h5 to a ground truth label .tif or .h5

# Visually Compare Button

- Select your Model Output File
- Select the Raw Images that this model output corresponds with (could be a .tif, .json, or .txt)
- Click the visually compare button
- The program will open a few windows showing the raw image and an image with the predicted labels overlayed over the image. This way you can visually inspect the performance of the model.

> Currently this is only implemented for semantic 2D, other types will be added soon.
