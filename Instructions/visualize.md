# Visualize

brief description

![Visualize Screen](https://github.com/ajbrookhouse/WSU_PlantBio_ML/blob/main/screenshots/visualizeScreenshot.png)

Here, you can add .ply files to the list of files to visualize by clicking the choose file button. You can choose as many or as few files as you want.

You can also pick the Choose Color button for each file. This will let you choose what color that specific file will be in the visualization

> For layers created by instance segmentation, the Choose color will be ignored, and colors will be assigned randomly to differentiate the different instances of the organelles.

Click the visualize button, and after some brief calculation and file loading, a 3D visualization window should appear that is interactive.
