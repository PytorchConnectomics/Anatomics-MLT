# Example Datasets

This folder contains a few things. First, there are a few files named \*Images.tif and \*Labels.tif.
These files are training and label images that can be used to train a model.

- chloroplastInstanceImages and chloroplastInstanceLabels are an example dataset for instance segmentation of chloroplasts.
- plasmSemanticImages and plasmSemanticLabels are an example dataset for semantic segmentation of the cell wall and plasmodesmata
- plateImage2D and plateLabel2D are an example dataset for semantic segmentation of 2D images of some sort of plate which has holes in it

A much larger stack of images to use for auto-labelling and testing will be added here soon:
- ![chloroplastInstance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPejSVwa5Z0002GnDQhjhM7O_MHYBXcC/view?usp=sharing), in case link does not work, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPejSVwa5Z0002GnDQhjhM7O_MHYBXcC/view?usp=sharing
- ![plasmSemantic]()
- ![plateImage2D]()
